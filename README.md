ClojureQL
=========

ClojureQL is an abstraction layer sitting on top of standard low-level JDBC SQL integration.
It let's you interact with a database through a series of objects which work as Clojure data
type.

ClojureQL is modeled around the primitives defined in Relational Algebra.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra

For the user this means that all queries compose and are never executed unless dereferenced
or called with a function that has the ! suffix.

As a help for debugging, wrap your statements in (binding [\*debug\* true]) to see the
compiled SQL statement printed to stdout.

Installation
============

Add the following to your **project.clj** or pom.xml:

Cake/Lein artifact:

    [clojureql "1.0.0"]
